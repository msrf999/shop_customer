A dataset called "Shop Customer Data‚Äù provides a summarized analysis of the top customers of a fancy shop. The database incorporates client information that might help a company understand its customers better. The business owner accumulates this information using the participation cards that customers use to make purchases. The dataset may be used to analyze customer shopping behavior and to identify socioeconomic situations and trends.

The dataset for the project consists of 2000 records and 8 columns. The columns are:

Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer
Gender: The gender of the customer
Age: The age of the customer
Annual Income: The annual income of the customer
